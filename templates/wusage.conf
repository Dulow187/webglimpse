# This is a sample wusage configuration file for use with Webglimpse
# Not all options are meaningful when analyzing our search logs, since we don't
# exactly match the full common log format for http hits.

# We place the search keywords in the field where the retrieved document normally goes

# This way you can get a quick analysis of what keywords the users are looking for.  If
# you are interested in what documents they actually retrieve, use your normal server logs.


#ESSENTIAL OPTIONS

# You can modify the following options as you like
# "documents" in this case refers to search terms

# We use 404 for searches w/no results and 304 for hits to the cache
days off

#must exist.

# We created WUSAGE_DIR during the install; each archive will get reports
# placed in a subdir of WUSAGE_DIR

#name of access_log file
#(no default; this is required). You must
#have one contiguous access_log file. 
#
#Unix gurus: If you want wusage to read its input
#from standard input, specify the character - as the logfile.

logdir |INDEXDIR|

#Your site's TOP-LEVEL domain (no default;
#this is required). If your machine is named
#tate.boutell.com, the correct setting
#is com (or possibly boutell.com if you add your
#local domain to the subdomains list; see below).
#This is required because some sites are
#listed in the log with a host name only.

#Change this if you are not a .com site

mydomain com

#daily, weekly, monthly, or summary (defaults to weekly).
#
#If summary is chosen, wusage produces just one
#report for the entire time period found in
#the access log file. In that case, the
#file summary.html in the reportdir will
#contain the results. Otherwise, look at
#index.html for an overview of the results
#and links to the individual reports.

#This keyword specifies the top URL of your site.
#This should be the root of your server's
#document tree, even if this is not your
#official "home page" (but it usually is).
#
#If this is specified, links that wusage generates
#will work even if the reports are opened as
#local files with a web browser.
#
#You do NOT need to end this with a /.

#Example: for my site (commented out)

#topurl http://iwhome.com/

#Normally, wusage places the index of its reports
#in the file index.html in the reportdir. You can
#change this name here.

#Example (commented out)

#indexname home.html

#SORTING ORDER

#By default, everything is sorted by access count.
#If you wish to sort by bytes transmitted instead,
#specify "order bytes". The only valid arguments to
#the order keyword are bytes and accesses.

order accesses

#SPECIFYING WHICH ACCESSES ARE IMPORTANT

#Normally the top ten most-accessed documents
#will be listed in the reports. To change this,
#adjust the setting below or set it to the
#word all to list all documents.

#Don't generate links in the list

#Treat URLs in a case insensitive manner if uncommented

#items to be included in your reports (see below
#for ways to make exceptions). It is
#very important that this list end
#with the line "end allow". * and ?

#For instance, *.gif matches anything
#ending in .gif. * alone matches everything.

#SITE CHARTING OPTIONS

#Comment out sites if you are not
#interested in knowing which sites
#accessed the server most often and so forth

sites

#Uncomment dns if you want wusage to 
#look up missing hostnames. NOTE: this
#can be a VERY slow operation, especially
#on slow links. It helps to run a local
#DNS server. If your access log already 
#contains hostnames for most accesses, you'll 
#want to leave this commented out so
#wusage won't waste time looking up
#addresses your web server couldn't
#find either. 

#dns

#By default, wusage will list the top ten
#sites accessing your server. You can
#change that number here or specify
#the word "all" for a complete list
#of all sites. Note: this can be a very
#large document. 

#Example: comment this out to list all
#sites, sorted by frequency of access,
#on the top "n" sites report.

topsites 10

#Sites to be allowed in statistics

allowsites
*
end allowsites

#Sites to be ignored in statistics

ignoresites
#Example: uncomment the line below
#to ignore all accesses from .com sites
#*.com
end ignoresites

#DOMAIN CHARTING OPTIONS

#Comment out domains if you are not
#interested in pie charts indicating
#which Internet domains accessed
#the server most often. PLEASE NOTE:
#if sites is not set, domains will
#be ignored.

domains

#By default, wusage will list the top ten
#top-level domains (and subdomains, when the
#subdomains keyword is used) accessing your server. 
#You can change that number here or specify
#the word "all" for a complete list
#of all top-level domains. Note: this can be 
#a fairly large document. 
#
#Example: uncomment the following keyword to list all
#top-level domains, sorted by frequency of access,
#on the top "n" domains report.

topdomains all

#Are there machines in your organization's
#network that don't have DNS entries (hostnames)?
#You can add entire subnets to a particular
#domain here.

fakedns
#
#First example: if the following line is uncommented, 
#everything in the specified subnet which does
#not have a real hostname is assumed to be
#part of the com domain for domain 
#statistics purposes.
#
#204.137.132.* com
#
#Second example: boutell.com is on the subdomains
#list (see below), so we add DNS-less machines in 
#the subnet to boutell.com rather than just com.
#
#204.137.132.* boutell.com
#
end fakedns

#To group various domains together so they
#will be listed as a single unit on the pie chart.
#The first item on each line is the name that will
#be given to all domains on that line. The first
#item can be a real domain or a "made-up" domain
#such as "Asia". Spaces are *not* permitted within
#the name. 

#NOTE: if a line is becoming too long, just add more entries for 
#the same name on several lines (see Europe below). 
#Do not enter a single line of more than 1024 characters.

#Are top-level domains not all that important
#for your Intra-net server? Do you want to know 
#how many accesses your server received from 
#specific subdomains of your company? Add those 
#subdomains to the subdomains list.

subdomains

#First example: you want to see accesses
#from your own company separate from
#all other accesses. To do this for
#hubrisoft.com, uncomment the following line.

#hubrisoft.com

#Second example: hubrisoft has four subdomains:
#marketing, sales, development and support.
#If the following four lines are uncommented, the
#domain ranking and pie chart will include
#separate totals for all machines in each of 
#these four domains.

#marketing.hubrisoft.com
#sales.hubrisoft.com
#development.hubrisoft.com
#support.hubrisoft.com

end subdomains

#If the server is accessible by the outside world,
#try running two separate wusage configurations
#with two separate report directories:
#one with *hubrisoft.com on the allowedsites list, 
#and the other with * on the allowedsites list.
