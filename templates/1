usage:   [-#abceghijklnprstwxyBCDEGIMNPQSVWZ] [-d DEL] [-f FILE] [-F PAT] [-H DIR] [-J HOST] [-K PORT] [-L X[:Y:Z]] [-R X] [-T DIR] [-Y D] pattern [files]
List of options (see http://webglimpse.net/ for more details):

-#: find matches with at most # errors
-a: print attribute names (useful only for Harvest SOIF format)
-b: print the byte offset of the record from the beginning of the file
-B: best match mode: find the closest matches to the pattern
-c: output the number of matched records
-C: send queries to glimpseserver
-d DEL: define record delimiter DEL
-D x: adjust the cost of deletions to x
-e: for patterns starting with -
-E: print matching lines as they appear in the index (useful in -EQNg)
-f FILE: restrict the search to files whose names appear in FILE
-F PAT: restrict the search to files matching PAT
-g: print the file number (in the index)
-G: output the (whole) files that contain a match
-h: do not output file names before matched record
-H DIR: the glimpse index is located in directory DIR
-i: case-insensitive search, e.g., 'a' = 'A'
-I x: adjust the cost of insertions to x
-j: output file modification dates (if -t was used for the indexing)
-J HOST: send queries to glimpseserver at HOST
-k: use the pattern as is (no meta characters)
-K PORT: send queries to glimpseserver at TCP port number PORT
-l: output only the names of files that contain a match
-L X[:Y:Z]: limit the output to X records [Y files, Z matches per file]
-n: output record prefixed by record number
-N: search only the index (may not be precise for some queries) 
-o: delimiter is output at the beginning of the matched record
-O: file names are printed only once per file
-p FILE:off:len:endian: restrict the search to the files whose names
	are specified as a bit-field OR sparse-set in FILE
-P: print the pattern that matched before the matched record
-q: print the offsets of the beginning and end of each matched record
-Q: (with -N) print offsets of matches from (only the large) index
-r: (used only for agrep) - recursive search
-R X: set the maximum size of a record to X
-s: display nothing except error messages
-S x: adjust the cost of substitutions to x
-t: use in combination with -d DEL so that the delimiter DEL appears
	at the end of each output record instead of the beginning
-T DIR: temporary files are put in directory DIR (instead of /tmp)
-u: do not output matched records (useful in -qbug)
-U: interpret .glimpse_filenames when -U / -X option is used in glimpseindex
-v: (works ONLY for agrep) - output all records that do not contain a match
-V,--version: print the current version of glimpse
-w: pattern has to match as a word, e.g., 'win' will not match 'wind'
-W: the scope of Booleans is the whole file (except for structured queries)
-x: the pattern must match the whole line
-X: if an indexed file that matches 'pattern' doesn't exist, print its name
-y: no prompt
-Y D: output only matches in files that were updated in the last D days
-z: customizable filtering using the .glimpse_filters file
-Z: no op
