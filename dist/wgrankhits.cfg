# See the source of the RankHits.pm module for exact evaluation rules.

# CHEESINESS WARNING - the default names below are currently hardcoded into wgindex.html and
# CustomOutputTool.pm.  You have to edit those files if you enter your own named ranking formulas.
# If anyone is actually doing this please email gvelez@iwhome.com and let me know to make it nice.
#
# Available variables are:
#
#	$N		# of times the word appears in the record
#	$LineNo		Where in the file the word appears
#	$TITLE		# of times the word appears in the TITLE tag
#	$FILE		# of times the word appears in the file path
#	$Days		Date (how many days old the file is)
#	$META		Total # of times the word appears in any META tag
#	$LinkPop	Link popularity in the site
#	%MetaHash	Hash with the # of times the word appears in each META tag,
#			indexed by the NAME= parameter of the meta tag.
#       $LinkString     actual url of link  
#	$QueryRegExp	a simplified version of the original query
# Starting with Webglimpse 2.3, multiple named formulas may be defined by starting a line with
#NAME: formula
# The "NAME" is case-insensitive, will be translated to upper case internally
# Must consist of letters, numbers, _ and - only, no other chars

# The following uncommented lines are the actual ranking formulae that will be used

# This is the default ranking, it gives high weight to keywords in the title, plus some weight to regular hits,
# link popularity and freshness

$TITLE * 10 + $N + $LinkPop + 5/($Days + 1)

# Here are some other sample formulas:
#
# To give weights to the Title and <META NAME="KEYWORDS" Content="..."> tags, plus regular hits
TITLE_AND_META:  $TITLE * 100 + $MetaHash{KEYWORDS} * 15 + $N

# To rank from most recent to oldest
AGE:  -$Days

# To rank by link popularity (ie number of other pages in the site pointing to this one)
LINKPOP:  $LinkPop

# To rank hits appearing in the title, or close to the beginning of the file first
NEARTOP: $TITLE * 5 + $N/($LineNo + 1)
