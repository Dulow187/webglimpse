<H2>Search Tips for Webglimpse</H2>
<p>
Webglimpse supports boolean queries and wildcards, as well as some 
limited regular expressions. 
Words separated by spaces are treated as a phrase.
You can use the keywords AND, OR and NOT, along with 
parenthesis, and the '#' character for wildcard matching.
<p>
<H3>Example boolean queries:</H3>
<form>
<blockquote>
	<table border=0>
	<tr><td>
	<input  name="ex1" value="tree AND leaf" size=30>
	</td><td>
	will match documents containing the words "tree" and "leaf" anywhere in the document
	</td></tr>
	<tr><td colspan=2><hr width="67%"></td></tr>

	<tr><td>
	<input  name="ex2" value="tree AND leaf AND NOT binary" size=30>
	</td><td>
	will match documents containing the words "tree" and "leaf" but not the word "binary"
	</td></tr>
	<tr><td colspan=2><hr width="67%"></td></tr>
	<tr><td>
	<input  name="ex3" value="open source OR shareware" size=30>
	</td><td>
	will match documents containing the phrase "open source" or the word "shareware"
	</td></tr>
	</table>
</blockquote>
<H3>Example use of wildcard <b>#</b>: </H3>
<blockquote>
	<table border=0 cellspacing=5>
	<tr><td>
	<input  name="ex4" value="lang#" size=30> 
	</td><td>
	will match 'language' and 'languages' but not 'slang' or 'clangs'.  This is different than checking the 'partial match' box in the query form,
which would match all three patterns.  
	</td></tr>
	<tr><td colspan=2><hr width="67%"></td></tr>
	<tr><td>
	<input name="ex5"  value="#lang#" size=30>
	</td><td>will match all patterns mentioned above - 'languages', 'language', 'slang' and 'clangs'.
This is the same effect as checking the 'partial match' box, but checking the box would be faster.
	</td></tr>
	<tr><td colspan=2><hr width="67%"></td></tr>
	<tr><td>
	<input name="ex6" value="www.#.com" size=30>
	</td><td>
	will match patterns like www.anything.com
	</td></tr>
	</table>
</blockquote>
When using complex queries like the above, you may sometimes get matches to code inside HTML tags instead of 
to the visible text in the file.  To avoid this, check the "Use Filters" box in the search options form.  (You should always
check this box when searching non-ascii type documents, like PDF or Word files.  If you don't see it on the form, it may have
been automatically checked for you in a hidden tag.)
<p>
<H3>There's more...</H3>

The above examples cover the most common types of queries.  Webglimpse (and glimpse) also 
can accept a limited form of regular expressions, including support for the '|', '*', '[]' characters and 
parentheses.  Please see <A HREF="http://webglimpse.net/glimpsehelp.html#sect7">the Glimpse man page Patterns section</A> for all the gory details.
You will need to know that Webglimpse calls glimpse with the switches  -U -W -j -y -z , plus others determined by the checkboxes on the form.  View the source
of the results page for the exact call to glimpse made by a particular webglimpse query.

the original ',' for OR, ';' for AND, and '~' for NOT</i>
