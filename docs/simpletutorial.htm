<p>Basically, there are three steps to having a Webglimpse search form on your site: install the software, configure the archives (indexes) and customize the web output.</p>
<p>Since the installation tasks will vary depending upon which version of Webglimpse you are installing and what system you are installing on, we will begin with an overview of configuring your site and creating the archives. (You can find detailed installation information under <a href="install.htm">Section III - Installation and Configuration</a>) </p>
<p>Once you complete your installation, you will see a message similar to the following:</p>
<table width="65%" border="0" bgcolor="#E5E5E5">
  <tr>
    <td><pre>********************************  
Done with install! You may use   
http://myserver.com/cgi-bin/wg2/wgarcmin.cgi  </pre></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>This is the path to the administrative module where you will do your archive configuration. You should copy and paste this path into your web browser and hit enter.</p>
<p>You will be prompted to enter the user name and password which you assigned during the install process. This will bring you to the archive manager.  If this is your first time installing, the list will be empty. Click the &quot;Add New   Archive&quot; button to begin. The New Archive screen will be presented to you, as shown in Figure 1 <a name="figure1" id="figure1"></a>below.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/8379f1.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="518" height="399" /></p>
<p>Here you can enter a title and description for your new archive, and optionally select a category and   language. The language doesn't restrict the sites you can include, but it does   select a template and character set for the search form and results page. Then   you will click on one of the buttons at the bottom:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Index by Directory: This option indexes files located on your Web server in a directory which you have specified. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Index by Site: This option will index everything at a particular Web site, either on   your server or somewhere else on the Net. Use this option for dynamic files on your own   server. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Index by Tree: This option will index the links beginning on a particular   page, with configurable settings for how many  &ldquo;hops&rdquo; or links and which ones to   follow. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>After entering the specific directory or URL to index and entering settings   such as maximum number of pages, you will come to the main control screen for   managing your archive. </p>
