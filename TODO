Warn user if run wgreindex as root when index files are owned differently

*** 'Name this page' in search box, just save keywords in page itself next time we reindex!  Then glimpse can index them normally, search fast, and using initial keyword place high in ranking (but don't print the actual keyword line)
USERKEYWORDS:uname:key1,key2,etc
USERKEYWORDS:anonymous:key1:#votes,key2:#votes,etc
later will need to be ableto manage/delete/timeout keywords, for now just add them

handle " " quoted string search phrase (don't translate AND/NOT/OR in between quotes)

DONE Highlighting query words
DONE  -pass highlight to mfs and to getfile
DONE  - need to form-encode highlight, should be simple pack command!

sometimes after adding new root, reindex with -f messes up the index
  need to delete .glimpse_index if new root was just added

need BASE HREF tag at start of search results to fix relative paths

copy wgindex.html to docroot if prompted/adding search boxes/ from wgcmd?
DONE test in demo area, live wg2, release 3.4.0

DONE Add search boxes/make neighborhoods
DONEsuck down a linktree to test with...need local files for add boxes

DONE: get wgconvert working on .nh files
     ? warn user about .nh* files in web area?
DONE test on http://localhost/webglimpse/webglimpse.net, why .wg_madenh size 0?
*** test addsearch by itself, add back into wgreindex if addboxes = 1
install: not askign about register when should, also stop recompiling every time!
warn from web interface that search boxes may not be added unless run with appropriate perms
provide help text describing how to run addsearch all by itself

   LATER can be wgRoot variable because # hops comes from root also
   LATER store which root generated each page, we will use for hops, ranking
   
Search within results

"Trunk" pages, traversed but not indexed

Use Filters should be an admin choice, not a user choice
save filtered version (as per Ravi) to save space & serach time
only problem will be with JumpToLine, make sure linebreaks within tags are preserved so that we can jump to the actual line
May not be able to jump to line for remote files unless we retrieve onthefly.

DONE output separate tables, not one big table
   include: checkbox for search within results
   down-arrow for not-good-result (ranklower), up-arrow for yes-good-result (rankhigher)

rank higher if keywords near each other

option to copy search page to docroot automatically if perms allow

do PDF files automatically

make archives - options for filtering, diff custom output templates

register at end of install?  (will keep track of main query page) 

Minimal, Typical, Custom installs
DONE- Redirects are broken??  (but every other time, not every time?  Has to do with zero-byte file deletion...? (was robots redirects)

- add switch to wgreindex when run from web

 - fix mfs jump-to-line on files w/spaces; replace mfs?

DONE - RULE for gathering domains, use any variant of this primary domain, including xxx.site.com
   (can we do this as a regexp for LimitPrefix? )
   (yes, I think so - need to test exactly as documented in tmplEditSite.html)

 - nice way of controlling & presenting stats from the webministration interface

 - templates or other rules to control what stats are gathered.

DONE  named ranking formulas 
 - option to print score for each hit
 - why not include LINK, TITLE, etc all in wgoutput.cfg

- allow both var name and nicename for ranking formulas??
*** - use real avail Ranking formulas in wgindex.html, not hardcoded list

 - when generating new wgindex.html, use actual available formulas, do not  hardcode

TEST linkpop var

DONE 12/9/01 *** - MONITORING component - send email to admin when things break
	done - archive not successfully built

  - Option to update all archive templates on upgrade

 - would be very nice to add search box to specific page, copy over wgindex.html,
provide source code in a documented format, OR add searchboxes to all pages 

 - Edit Root & change URL - delete & add new
 
DONE  - LimitPrefix -either set explicitly or default better on subdirs
