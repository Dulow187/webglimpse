This is WebGlimpse, developed by Udi Manber, Michael Smith,
and Burra Gopal at the University of Arizona.

Version 2.X developed by Golda Velez of Internet Workshop and
many individual contributors.

All information about Glimpse and WebGlimpse can be found on the web at

----------------------------------------------------------
Webglimpse requires Glimpse.  If you don't have Glimpse, 
go to http://webglimpse.net/download.php and get a copy.  
----------------------------------------------------------
To install Webglimpse, 

0) Extract the distribution files into a temporary directory 
(You probably already did this since you're reading this file)

1) Run wginstall and answer the questions

2) Point your browser to the URL given at the end
of the installation.

3) Create a new archive using the web interface.

4) The search form called wgindex.html will be 
created in the archive directory.  You can copy 
this form into your own pages and format it as you like.

5) The reindex script called wgreindex will also be
in the archive directory.  If you want the archive
reindexed regularly you can put this in a crontab.  Otherwise
you can reindex from the web interface by hand.


------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE:  If you are installing in place of an old version, AND you 
have changed the home webglimpse directory, please 

	rm  .glimpse*
	rm  .wg*
	rm  archive.cfg
	rm  wgreindex

in all of your previously indexed directories.
